The provided code establishes an RFID-based access control system using an ESP8266 microcontroller programmed with MicroPython.
It begins by initializing three GPIO pins to control peripherals: a buzzer (`buzzer`), a red LED (`RLed`), and a green LED (`GLed`).
These components are crucial for providing both visual and auditory feedback based on the RFID tag detected by the system.

Central to the functionality is the MFRC522 RFID module, instantiated as `rc522`, which interfaces with the ESP8266 via SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) using specific pins (`sck`, `miso`, `mosi`, `cs`, `rst`). This module facilitates the reading of RFID tags placed within its range.

Upon execution, the program enters an infinite loop (`while True:`) to continuously monitor for the presence of an RFID card. It initiates a request (`rc522.request(rc522.REQALL)`) to detect any RFID tag nearby. If a tag is detected (`stat == rc522.OK`), the code proceeds to retrieve the unique identifier (UID) of the detected card (`raw_uid`). This UID is then formatted into a hexadecimal string (`rfid_data`) for easier comparison.

The system compares the `rfid_data` against a predefined list of authorized user IDs.
If a match is found for one of these IDs, specific actions are triggered. For instance, the green LED (`GLed`) is illuminated at 50% brightness (`GLed.value(0.5)`) to indicate successful authentication for the corresponding user. Each authorized user ID is associated with a distinct response, enabling different user privileges or actions upon authentication.

In cases where the `rfid_data` does not match any authorized ID, signaling an unauthorized access attempt, the code activates the buzzer (`buzzer.value(1)`) and briefly turns on the red LED (`RLed.value(1)`) to alert of the unauthorized access. This visual and auditory feedback mechanism provides immediate notification regarding the status of each access attempt.

After signaling unauthorized access, the system pauses briefly (`utime.sleep(1)`) before resuming its scan for RFID cards.
This continuous loop ensures ongoing monitoring and feedback, making the system suitable for basic access control applications requiring RFID authentication with immediate user feedback on access attempts.

Overall, this implementation effectively demonstrates the integration of RFID technology with GPIO control on the ESP8266 platform, showcasing its utility in access control scenarios where quick and clear feedback is essential for security monitoring and management.
